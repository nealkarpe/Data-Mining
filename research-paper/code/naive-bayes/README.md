###### split_70_30.py

* Run `python3 split_70_30.py` (make sure `heart-disease.csv` is in same directory)
	* Output will be `accuracy_histogram.png` along with accuracies printed to stdout

###### leave_out_1.py

* Run `python3 leave_out_1.py` (make sure `heart-disease.csv` is in same directory)
	* Output will be accuracy printed to stdout
